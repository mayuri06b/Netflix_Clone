# Netflix Clone 🎬

A pixel-perfect Netflix homepage clone built with pure HTML and CSS, showcasing responsive design principles and modern web development techniques.

## 🌟 About This Project

This project represents my journey from design to development - starting as a Figma design enthusiast and transitioning into hands-on coding. What began as a design exploration became my first major step into real web development, marking the beginning of my coding journey.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works seamlessly across all devices
- **Pixel-Perfect UI**: Faithful recreation of Netflix's homepage design
- **Pure CSS**: Built without any frameworks, demonstrating core CSS skills
- **Modern Layout Techniques**: Utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts

- **CSS3**: Advanced styling with custom properties, animations, and responsive design
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For complex layouts and component positioning
- **Media Queries**: Responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes

## 🎨 Design Process

This project started in Figma where I:
- Analyzed Netflix's design system
- Created wireframes and mockups
- Established color palettes and typography
- Planned the responsive behavior

Then transitioned to code implementation, bringing the design to life with clean, maintainable HTML and CSS.
